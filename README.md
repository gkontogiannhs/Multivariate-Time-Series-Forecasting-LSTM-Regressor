### Multivariate-Time-Series-Forecasting-LSTM-Regressor

*The major problem with renewable energy sources is that they are not available when they're needed. In order to meet the additional needs, electricity providers mainly use fossil fuels.*    

In this project, a Multivariate Time Series Forecasting model based on LSTM neural networks is trained, utilizing the Multi-step technique, in order to predict for each moment of the day how much energy is required to be produced from non-renewable sources.
